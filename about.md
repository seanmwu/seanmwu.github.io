<p><b>I am a graduating Master’s student in aerospace engineering at the University of California, Davis.</b></p>


<p>As a member of Professor C.P. van Dam’s Applied Aerodynamics Research Group, I developed competence in: computational and experimental aerodynamics, aircraft design, and optimization. Additionally, I gained experience advising undergraduate researchers and student design teams, as well as team managerial experience leading a radiosondes field research team. Currently, I manage the

<p><b>My professional interests are a reflection of my personal hobbies</b></p>

<p>I am an avid aviation enthusiast. I began flying when I was 14, have a private pilot certificate with ratings for single-engine airplanes and gliders, and am building a kit-built, Van's RV-12 airplane as a family hobby project. Recently, I obtained a Remote Pilot certificate while serving as a grader for an undergraduate course on UAVs.

<br><p>At UC Davis, I apply my knowledge of aero-hydro dynamics as a club advisor, webmaster, and past V.P. of Equipment for the UC Davis Sailing Team.</p>
