<br><b>I am a graduating Master’s student in aerospace engineering at the University of California, Davis.</b>


<p>I'm a graduating master’s candidate (Dec. 2017) at UC Davis with emphasis in aerodynamics, aircraft design and optimization; and a passion for advancing aeronautics.</p>

<p>At Davis, I managed the aeronautical wind tunnel, mentored 6 undergraduate researchers, advised 11 student capstone design teams, led a radiosonde field team, and am currently defining a wind tunnel test for a multi-element airfoil with active flow control. </a>.

        <p>I am an avid aviation enthusiast. I began flying when I was 14, have a private pilot certificate with ratings for single-engine airplanes and gliders, and am building a kit-built, Van's RV-12 airplane as a family hobby project. Recently, I obtained a remote pilot certificate while serving as a grader for an undergraduate course on UAVs.</p>
